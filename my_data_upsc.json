An additional benefit is that the amount so written off reduces the bank’s tax liability.\n\nThe bank writes off a loan after the borrower has defaulted on the loan repayment and there is a very low chance of recovery. The lender then moves the defaulted loan, or NPA, out of the assets side and reports the amount as a loss.\n\nAfter the write-off, banks are supposed to continue their efforts to recover the loan using various options. They have to make provisioning as well.

When this is accompanied by excess debt, the cyclical slowdown can be prolonged or it may become structural.\n\n \n\nA structural slowdown, on the other hand, is a more deep-rooted phenomenon that occurs due to a one-off shift from an existing paradigm. The changes, which last over a long-term, are driven by disruptive technologies, changing demographics, and/or change in consumer behaviour.",

The Maratha Empire was eventually taken over by the British. After a series of Anglo-Maratha Wars in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the British East India Company gradually eroded Maratha power. The empire effectively ended with the defeat of Peshwa Bajirao II in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1818).",

Din Ilahi was more of a syncretic spiritual movement that combined elements from various religions, and it had limited followers, mostly among Akbar’s close courtiers.\n\nThe statement 2 is correct. Akbar ordered the construction of the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) in his new capital Fatehpur Sikri in 1575. This institution was designed to host religious debates and discussions among scholars of various faiths, reflecting Akbar’s interest in different religious philosophies.",
